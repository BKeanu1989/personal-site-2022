    Safebox is a company, which offers lockers & energy at festivals. You can charge your phone and even laptops with it. All the lockers are in shipping containers.

    The software itself can take new orders, import orders from the shop and visualizes the containers (if lockers are in use or not).  
    At festivals it's normal to not have an internet connection. So the software itself needs to have a local database. I used sqlite for this case. 
    To mimik a server, the app itself can communicate via wlan. The client is shareable so anybody in the network can also use the app.
