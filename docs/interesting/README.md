[Tutorial](/tutorials/dark-mode.md)

There are at least two huge advantages using dark mode themes

### Advantages
- saves energy 
- easy on your eyes
- users are happy not getting blended by your website

### Disadvantages
- Display might not be visible in broad daylight
- Scans (eg. QR Codes) need higher contrast -> light theme
